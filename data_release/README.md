# Data Release

We release our datasets in [huggingface datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/). 


### A1: LLVisionQA (Perception)

Specifically, for methods to improve their low-level ability, we split the datasets into two-halves: the `dev` subset, and the `test` subset, with release information shown as follows:

The respective images are in the `images.tar` under the huggingface [repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nanyangtu/LLDescribe), as well as the json files for `dev` and `test` subsets.


## A2: LLDescribe (Description)

Only images are released in `images.tar`. Please refer [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nanyangtu/LLDescribe) to download them.
