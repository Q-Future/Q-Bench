The proposed Q-Bench includes three realms for low-level vision: perception (A1), description (A2), and assessment (A3).

- For perception (A1) /description (A2), we collect two benchmark datasets LLVisionQA/LLDescribe.
- We are open to **submission-based evaluation** for the two tasks. The details for submission is as follows.
- For assessment (A3), as we use **public datasets**, we provide an abstract evaluation code for arbitrary MLLMs for anyone to test.

## Close-source MLLMs (GPT-4V-Turbo, Gemini, Qwen-VL-Plus, GPT-4V)

  <div style="width: 55%; text-align: center; margin:auto;">
      <img style="width:55%" src="gpt-4v-vs-human.png">
  </div>

We test on three close-source API models, GPT-4V-Turbo (`gpt-4-vision-preview`, replacing the no-longer-available *old version* GPT-4V results), Gemini Pro (`gemini-pro-vision`) and Qwen-VL-Plus (`qwen-vl-plus`). Slightly improved compared with the older version, GPT-4V still tops among all MLLMs and almost a junior-level human's performance. Gemini Pro and Qwen-VL-Plus follows behind, still better than best open-source MLLMs (0.65 overall).


|**Participant Name** | yes-or-no | what | how | distortion | others | in-context distortion | in-context others | overall |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | -| - | - | 
| Qwen-VL-Plus (`qwen-vl-plus`) | 0.7574 |  0.7325 |  0.5733|  0.6488 | 0.7324 | 0.6867 | 0.7056 | 0.6893 |
| Gemini-Pro (`gemini-pro-vision`) | 0.7221 |  0.7300 |0.6645 | 0.6530 | 0.7291 | 0.7082 | 0.7665 | 0.7058 |

We have also evaluated several new open-source models recently, and will release their results soon.



## Submission Guideline for A1/A2

### Option 1: Submit Results

#### Step 1: Download Images

We now provide two ways to download the datasets (LLVisionQA\&LLDescribe)

- via GitHub Release: Please see our [release](https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Bench/releases/tag/v1.0.1.1014datarelease) for details.

- via Huggingface Datasets: Please refer to the [data release notes](/data_release) to download the images.

#### Step 2: Test with Your Model

It is highly recommended to convert your model into Huggingface format to smoothly test these data. See the [example scripts for Huggingface's IDEFICS-9B-Instruct](/example_code_for_idefics) as an example, and modify them for your custom model to test on your model.


**Please email `haoning001@e.ntu.edu.sg` to submit your result in json format.**


### Option 2: Submit Model

You can also submit your model (could be Huggingface AutoModel or ModelScope AutoModel) to us, alongside your custom evaluation scripts. Your custom scripts can be modified from the [template scripts](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/llava/eval/model_vqa_qbench.py) that works for LLaVA-v1.5 (for A1/A2), and [here](example_code_for_idefics/a3_assessment_all.py) (for image quality assessment).

**Please email `haoning001@e.ntu.edu.sg` to submit your model if you are _outside_ China Mainland.**
**Please email `zzc1998@sjtu.edu.cn` to submit your model if you are _inside_ China Mainland.**


## A1: Perception

A snapshot for LLVisionQA benchmark dataset for MLLM low-level perception ability is as follows. See the [leaderboard](leaderboards/) here.

![Picture](llvisionqa_db.png)

We measure the answer accuracy of MLLMs (provided with the question and all choices) as the metric here.

## A2: Description

A snapshot for LLDescribe benchmark dataset for MLLM low-level description ability is as follows. See the [leaderboard](leaderboards/) here.

![Picture](lldescribe.png)

We measure the _completeness_, _precision_, and _relevance_ of MLLM descriptions as the metric here.

## A3: Assessment

_An exciting ability that MLLMs are able to predict quantitative scores for IQA!_

### Methodology

![Picture](llmiqa.png)

### Predict a Score

#### Pseudo Code

Similarly as above, as long as a model (based on causal language models) has the following two methods: `embed_image_and_text` (to allow multi-modality inputs), and `forward` (for computing logits), the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) with the model can be achieved as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image
from my_mllm_model import Model, Tokenizer, embed_image_and_text

model, tokenizer = Model(), Tokenizer()

prompt = "##User: Rate the quality of the image.\n" \
         "##Assistant: The quality of the image is" ### This line can be modified based on MLLM's default behaviour.

good_idx, poor_idx = tokenizer(["good","poor"]).tolist()

image = Image.open("image_for_iqa.jpg")
input_embeds = embed_image_and_text(image, prompt)
output_logits = model(input_embeds=input_embeds).logits[0,-1]
q_pred = (output_logits[[good_idx, poor_idx]] / 100).softmax(0)[0]
```

\*Note that you can modify the second line based on your model's default format, _e.g._ for [Shikra](https://github.com/shikras/shikra), the "##Assistant: The quality of the image is" is modified as "##Assistant: The answer is". It is okay if your MLLM will first answer "Ok, I would like to help! The image quality is", just replace this into line 2 of the prompt.

#### Example Real Code for IDEFICS

We further provide a full implementation of IDEFICS on IQA. See [example](example_code_for_idefics/README.md) on how to run IQA with this MLLM. Other MLLMs can also be modified in the same way for use in IQA.

#### Compute SRCC/PLCC with IQA databases

We have prepared JSON format human opinion scores (MOS) for the seven IQA databases as evaluated in our benchmark.

Please see [IQA_databases](a3_iqa_databases/) for details.
